#### Creating a repository on Github.com from the terminal
#### step by step


1. 
	Create an empty repository on github.com (on the website)
	create it without providing README or license files.
	for avoiding any further issues, you can always add them lately.

2. 
	On our local machine
	Navigate through the root of our project and run git initializer command

	$ git init

3. 
	Adding files to our new local directory, for this run command

	$ git add .

4.
	Commiting the staged files to the local repository

	$ git commit -m "comment goes here"

5. 
	Returning to the github.com page and copying the url of our project.
	Must look similar to this example
	"https://github.com/iasonweb/maven_hello_world.git"

6.
	adding remote repository to our local repository, for futher pushing
	
	$ git remote add origin remote-repo-url
		### remote-repo-url for this see upper example

	$ git remote -v
		## verifies the new remote URL

7.
	Push changes to GitHub
